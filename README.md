-->🚀 Passionate Full-Stack Developer | Creative Design Enthusiast

I'm Faye, a versatile professional with a background in creative design and full-stack development.

🎓 Graduating with a master's degree in digital media production, I initially cut my teeth as a creative designer in a dynamic agency environment. Over the years, I've honed my skills in visual storytelling, user experience design, and digital media production.

🚀 Transitioning to Full-Stack Development

Driven by a desire to bridge the gap between creativity and functionality, I made a pivot towards full-stack development. I embraced a 24-week bootcamp, where I delved into the intricacies of both front-end and back-end technologies. From designing visually compelling interfaces to crafting robust and scalable applications, I've discovered a newfound love for the dynamic world of coding.

🌐 Skills Snapshot:

Front-End: JavaScript, React, Redux, HTML, CSS
Back-End: Node.js, Express.js, Flask
Databases: MySQL
Tools & Version Control: Git, GitHub
Responsive Design: Ensuring seamless user experiences across devices

💡 Passion for Problem-Solving

What fuels my enthusiasm in full-stack development is the thrill of problem-solving. Debugging code, optimizing performance, and creating efficient solutions are the puzzles that keep me engaged. It's not just about writing lines of code; it's about crafting digital experiences that leave a lasting impact.

🌈 Beyond Tech: A Canvas and Colors Enthusiast

Outside the world of tech, you'll find me exploring the canvas with sketching and oil painting. Art is not just a hobby; it's my way of balancing the analytical with the imaginative.

Let's connect! I'm eager to collaborate, learn, and contribute to projects that marry creativity with cutting-edge technology. 🚀✨
